# C-Mini-Project
ApniCar- Car Rental System

As a part of my First year course CS110 , our team created
a software to demonstrate the ease of booking a car online
through an app or website. It has various features like 
Real life like rates depending on the range, Car return 
function, User ratings and suggestions, barring the user
to book twice without returning the first booking and many
more features. We created this program entirely using C.
